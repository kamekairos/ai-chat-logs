# Human-AI Co-Project: Music Generation

## Introduction

* Discussed the idea of generating music using AI
* Created a song prompt for an AI music generator
* Wrote lyrics for a full pop song structure

## Audio Analysis

* Used the "audio-classification" model to analyze the audio files
* Extracted features from the audio files using the "features-extraction" model
* Analyzed the text representation of the song using the pastebin link

## Results

* The "audio-classification" model predicted that the audio segment was mostly silence
* The "features-extraction" model extracted various audio features, including spectral features and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)
* The text representation of the song showed a mix of harmonic and percussive elements

## Conclusion

* The human-AI co-project was a success, with the AI generating a full pop song structure and lyrics
* The audio analysis provided valuable insights into the audio features and structure of the song
* The project demonstrated the potential of human-AI collaboration in creative tasks
