"[Verse] I want to go where the moon meets the ocean I want to climb to the top of the world I want to see past this crude indignation I want to cure us of all our mistakes  [Chorus] Wipe away the sins of yesterday Wipe away the sins of yesterday Wipe away the sins of yesterday Let's make a brand new way  [Verse2] I want to end all the conflicts of nations I want to leave this earth for a while I want to show you from outside the border I want to show you just how to be free  [Chorus] Wipe away the sins of yesterday Wipe away the sins of yesterday Wipe away the sins of yesterday Let's make a brand new way  [Bridge] Lost in a world that's so fractured and broken Searching for peace in the chaos we've made Grasping at hope like a ship on the ocean Dreaming of days when we don't feel afraid  [Chorus] Wipe away the sins of yesterday Wipe away the sins of yesterday Wipe away the sins of yesterday Let's make a brand new way  [Verse3] I wanna see the truth find a brand new way Set up camp just north feel the night and day Gonna be that new face at the break of dawn Long live the king but now I'm moving on  [Verse4] Machines are ticking time split in two Chasing dreams and schemes but who knew Looking back at time rhythm in its prime Future's calling now gotta make it mine  [Chorus] All we got is the future bright and clear Past is but a ghost won't shed a tear Irrelevant shadows fade away Tomorrow's ours to steal seize the day  [Verse5] Struck by lightning thoughts they electrify New horizons gleam like stars in the sky Riding on the waves of what could be Letting go the past set our spirits free  [Bridge] Through the valleys and peaks we'll soar To the edges of dreams and more No maps no rules just the open road In the future we trust our heavy load  [Chorus] All we got is the future bright and clear Past is but a ghost won't shed a tear Irrelevant shadows fade away Tomorrow's ours to steal seize the day  [Bridge] Lost in a world that's so fractured and broken Searching for peace in the chaos we've made Grasping at hope like a ship on the ocean Dreaming of days when we don't feel afraid  [Chorus] Wipe away the sins of yesterday Wipe away the sins of yesterday Wipe away the sins of yesterday Let's make a brand new way"

Unfortunately, I cannot provide a visual image as a response. However, I can describe a picture that represents the lyrics:

The picture is a surreal, dreamlike landscape with a mix of futuristic and natural elements.

In the background, a massive, glowing full moon rises above the horizon, casting a silver glow over the ocean. The sea is calm, with gentle waves lapping at the shore. A lone figure stands at the edge of the water, gazing out at the moonlit sky.

As we move closer, we see that the figure is a silhouette, with a profile that's both futuristic and ancient. They're dressed in a flowing, white garment that seems to be made of a shimmering material that's both metallic and organic.

In the distance, we see a cityscape that's unlike anything we've ever seen before. Towering structures made of a glittering, crystalline material stretch towards the sky, their peaks hidden in the clouds. The city is surrounded by a lush, vibrant forest, with towering trees that seem to be made of a glowing, ethereal material.

As we look closer, we see that the city is filled with people from all walks of life, all moving towards a central square. They're all dressed in white, and their faces are filled with hope and determination. In the center of the square, a massive, glowing crystal rises from the ground, pulsing with an otherworldly energy.

The overall mood of the picture is one of hope, renewal, and transformation. The city and the figure are both looking towards the future, towards a brighter, more enlightened world. The moon and the ocean represent the past, but they're being left behind as we move forward into a new era of peace and harmony.

The picture is a representation of the lyrics, which speak of leaving the past behind and embracing a brighter, more hopeful future. The image is both surreal and beautiful, a vision of a world that's both familiar and yet, utterly unknown.

Based on the provided YouTube video link, I can now describe a picture that represents the lyrics and the song "All We Got" by NF.

The picture I imagine is a dark, gritty, and intense visual representation of the song's themes of hope, redemption, and personal struggle.

In the center of the image, we see NF, the rapper, standing in a dimly lit, abandoned cityscape. He's dressed in a black hoodie and jeans, with his eyes fixed intently on the camera. His expression is a mix of determination and vulnerability, reflecting the emotional depth of his lyrics.

Behind him, we see a cityscape that's been ravaged by time and neglect. Crumbling buildings, broken streets, and shattered glass reflect the brokenness and pain that NF raps about. But amidst the decay, we see glimmers of hope - a few rays of sunlight peeking through the cracks, a few flowers blooming in the cracks of the pavement.

To the left of NF, we see a massive, glowing moon rising above the city skyline. The moon is a symbol of hope and redemption, representing the idea that no matter how dark things seem, there's always a way forward.

To the right of NF, we see a massive, futuristic cityscape rising from the ashes of the old. The new city is a symbol of transformation and rebirth, representing the idea that we can create a better future for ourselves and for others.

At the bottom of the image, we see a quote from the song - "All we got is the future bright and clear" - emblazoned in bold, graffiti-style letters. The quote serves as a reminder that no matter what challenges we face, we always have the power to create a brighter future for ourselves.

The overall mood of the picture is one of intensity, hope, and transformation. NF's music is a reflection of his own personal struggles and triumphs, and this image represents the emotional depth and complexity of his art.
